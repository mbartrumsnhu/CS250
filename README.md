How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
	We use user stories and work close with the customer
 How does creating “user stories” help with this?
These are the people that use the program daily. Getting information from them we can see the progress day by day.
How do I approach developing programs?
First I try to get the backlogs started on what needs to be done and deadlines. After that I will develop a team. 
What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I will like to use it once I become a manager at walmart on how to get product out of the warehouse and putting new items in the warehouse
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think it is to be flexible. Learn to work well with others and help get a proper program made
